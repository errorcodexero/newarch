If you changes the tracking mode (auto, semi-auto, manual), you must hit direction and height
again to reset internal state of the robot.

If you change the cargo/hatch switch, you must hit direction and height again to reset the interernal
state of the robot.

We need a way to manage the finger on the hatch holder so that if we lose a hatch, we retract the
finger, but not interfer with collect and place operations.
