This is a very simple GOPIGO3 robot.  It uses the FRC emulation software layer
but does not rely on the Error Code Xero software architecture at all.

This robot only builds for the GOPIGO platform by typing ...

make PLATFORM=GOPIGO CONFIG=Debug (or Release)

Some notes on the behavior of the robot.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The front of the robot is the side with the servo (camera, ultra-sonic, etc.)
The side with the metal canister is the back of the robot.

With no reversals applied ...

A positive power to the right side of the robot makes the right 
wheel go backward.

A positive power to the left side of the robot makes the left
wheel go forward.
