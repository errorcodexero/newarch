/// \mainpage The Error Code Xero Robot Framework
///
/// This software framework is the robot framework used by Error Code Xero.  It is
/// divided into three distinct namespaces.  The xero::math namespace contains classes
/// that implement low level math used by the robot algorithms.  The xero::misc namespace
/// contains classes that are used by the robot code, but do not depend on the libraries
/// provided by first in any way.  This makes these classes reusable on external processors
/// like the raspberry PI.  The final name space, xero::base, contains the robot code that
/// is dependent on the libraries from first, notably the WPILIB libraries.
///
/// More information on the architecture can be found at https://www.xerosw.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=software:robot_software_architecture.
