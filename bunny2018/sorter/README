Sorts balls by color, has a wheel that spins in in either direction depending on the ball color. 
One direction gets balls ready to be put in buckets, other direction spits balls out. 
Needs a color sensor, a motor to spin the wheel both ways and an encoder to make sure it only 
spins far enough to allow the next ball in.
