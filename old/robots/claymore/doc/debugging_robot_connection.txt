To check connectivity:
	- Check wifi connection through Network and Sharing Center on Windows
	- Open driver station and go to diagnostics tab
	- Ping robot radio
	- Ping roborio
	- Ethernet directly into the router and try all of these again
	
To debug, try:
	- Make sure you're connected to the right router (and that no other routers are broadcasting with the same ip)
	- Make sure driver station team number matches that of the radio and the roborio
	- Check ethernet connection between roborio and radio (replace if necessary) and that it connects to the radio in the port farthest from the power cable
	- If the diagnostics tab of the driver station reads connected to robot radio but not robot, restart the robotio
	- Restart the robot
	- Restart the driver station
	- Restart the driver station computer
	- Reconfigure the router using the Radio Configuration Utility

Last resorts:
	- Check software running on roborio and radio at https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/305566-current-software-revisions 
	- Reimage roborio
