This is the list of automodes and what they do.
-----------------------------------------------

Number: 0
Start: Left, Center, Right
Objectives:
a. Calibrate the lifter and grabber
b. Drop the collector

Number: 1
Start: Left, Right
Objectives:
a. Calibrate the lifter and grabber
b. Drop the collector
c. Cross the line only

Number: 2
Start: Center
Objectives:
a. Calibrate the lifter and grabber
b. Drop the collector
c. If the right switch lights up
   c1. Score the right side of the switch
   c2. Collect second cube from center pile
   c3. Move to the side of the field that is our scale.  Use the intake_auto and
       grabber_auto switches to tell us if the alliance partner on that side has
       a scale program.  If they do, we move further up the corridor outside the
       switch and closer to the scale.
d. If the left swidth lights up
   d1. Score the left side of the switch
   d2. Collect second cube from center pile
   d3. Move to the side of the field that is our scale.  Use the intake_auto and
       grabber_auto switches to tell us if the alliance partner on that side has
       a scale program.  If they do, we move further up the corridor outside the
       switch and closer to the scale.

Notes:
If the practice bot collector does not stay up, we may need to test the collector speedup on
the practice field in Auburn.  It is trivial to test and can be easily reverted if we are
worried
