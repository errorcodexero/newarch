This repository is for the 2018 competition robot.  The directory is self contained
and can be built with make and the compilers.  The requirements for each platform are
given below.  All invokations of make must include a CONFIG variable.  The only config
types support are 'release' and 'debug'.  It is intended that the robot run competitions
using the 'release' type.

Just typing make without a target (e.g. make CONFIG=debug) will build the local target.
This works at this robot level, or in any of the sub directories.

Using the deploy target (e.g. make CONFIG=debug deploy) works only at the top level robot
directory or in the roborio directory.  It builds the robot and deploys to the robot.  The
robot is located using the mDNS address roborio-1425-frc.local.  This can be overridden with
the DEPLOYHOST environment variable.  In base, export DEPLOYHOST=10.14.25.2 will set the
robot as the IP address 10.14.25.2.  Note, using an IP address is generally much faster than
waiting on the mDNS address to resolve.

Windows:
The cygwin packages should be installed and the development packages installed as part
of that.  

Linux:
The ARM tool chains (c++ compiler) must be installed and in your path.

Mac OS:
The ARM tool chains (c++ compiler) must be instaleld and in your path.

Note, the repository contains all required libraries including WPILIB, NavX, and
CTRE.  No need to install these on your machine.
