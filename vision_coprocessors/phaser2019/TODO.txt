- Capability
  - Fix exposure, etc. at startup.  Make independent of current light conditions.
  - Add window dimensions to param file, import and set, use for yaw calc.
  - Param for converting pixels between centres (horizontal) to distance.
  - Compute estimated distance and yaw, publish to network table.
  - Detect if running on robot, operare network tables in client vs. server mode automatically.
  - Measure pipeline+detection latency *and* fps.  With both raspicam and USB cam.
  - Support separate cameras for viewing vs. tracking.
  - Tracking cargo.

- Accuracy
  - Check consistency of areas of rectangles vs. each other vs. distance.  Facing straight.  Vary distance.
  - Filter rectangles on their tilt + confirm left vs. right tilt within ranges.
  - Tune HSV thresholds.  Add ability to tune interactively on Pi with trackbars.
  - Ratio of real distance vs. #pixels assumed to be the same in both dimensions.
    Characterize and handle differences for accuracy.

- Efficiency
  - Minimize temp objects.
  - Don't annotate image if not going to stream output.

- Maintainability
  - Fix communication between network elements.
  - Split generic parts into xerolib + split both generic and game-specific parts into multiple files.

- Pi
  - Change back to read-only by default.
