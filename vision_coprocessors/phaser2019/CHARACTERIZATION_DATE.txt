- Estimating distance based on 60 degree [horizonal?] fov per spec
  Assume dist between centres = 0.92ft (11in)
  Consider mid point above where pixels between centers ~= 400 pixels.  200 from center.
  30 (60/2) deg ~ 320 pixels.
  320/dist_in_pix = tan(30)
  tan(angle) = 200/dist_in_pix=200tan(30)/320=0.3608
  [angle=47.269]

  tan(angle) = 0.3608 = 0.46ft/dist_in_in
  dist_in_in = .46/0.3608 = 1.275 ft  <== too far off 1.90 measured dist
