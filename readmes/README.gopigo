The gopigo3 specific code if found under the gopigo3 directory.  This includes both the NAVX library,
the hardware support library, and the FRC emulation library.  In addition, the gopigo3 specific robots
are there as well.

The gopigo3simple robot is a very simple robot that just runs the motors on the drive base for a fixed
amount of time.  It also prints the start and end time for the auto modes.

The gopigo3xero robot is a robot that uses the current new robot architecture.  This robot includes addition
subsystem for the servo.

The build method assumes cygwin (like all things under windows for team 1425).  It is best if the 64 bit version
of cygwin is installed (versus the 32 bit version).

To build these robots you need the Raspberry PI cross compiler.  The cross compiler can be found at 
http://gnutoolchains.com/raspberry/.  This must be installed on your machine and must by in your cygwin 
path.

The makefiles have been moved into the robot directories (e.g. gopigo3simple and gopigo3xero).  In each
of these directories, the following targets are valid:

all
Builds the robot executable.

deploy
Copies the robot executable to the PI.  This assumes that the environment variable GOPIGOIP is set.  for
instance export GOPIGOIP=192.168.1.86.  This target builds and then copies the robot executable to the
home directory of the pi user on the robot.  You will be prompted for a password unless the robot if setup
with the right authorized keys for SSH to work without passwords.

run
Runs the robot executable on the PI.  For now, this only runs the auto mode for 15 seconds.  (Note there is some
kind of bug which causes the robot to keep running but in the disabled state after auto mode is complete.  Hitting
Control-C for now will stop it.)
