This file describes the robot simulator.  The simulator is a simple and ideal
simulator that allows you to write robot code without a robot.  The simulator is
used by linking your robot code against the simualtor version of the WPILIB instead
of the roborio version.

With the simulator, when you run you robot code, you can supply command line
arguments.  The following command line arguments are defined.

--start time - the amount of time to delay before beginning the autonomous period
--auto time - the length of the autonomous period
--oper time - the length of the teleop period
--simtime time - the length of time between position reports from the simulator
--show - if present, print messages about the simulator transitions between modes
