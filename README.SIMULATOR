This file describes the robot simulator.  The simulator is a simple and ideal
simulator that allows you to write robot code without a robot.  The simulator is
used by linking your robot code against the simualtor version of the WPILIB instead
of the roborio version.

With the simulator, when you run you robot code, you can supply command line
arguments.  The following command line arguments are defined.

--start time - the amount of time to delay before beginning the autonomous period
--auto time - the length of the autonomous period
--oper time - the length of the teleop period
--speed factor - the ratio or real time to simulation time, 2.0 means twice as slow as real time
--simprint - print the simualtor output on the standard error stream
--simfile file - print the simulator output to a file given by 'file'
--simscreen - run the full screen simulator mode
--simprop propstring - set a property for the simulator (only one property is used now)
  cube=time,time,time - this causes the cube detect sensor model to detect at each time given
